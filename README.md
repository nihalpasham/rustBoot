# rustBoot 
rustBoot is a standalone bootloader, written entirely in `Rust`, designed to run on anything from a microcontroller to a system on chip. It can be used to boot into bare-metal firmware or Linux.

## Why rustBoot?

rustBoot aims to offer an OS and micro-architecture agnostic (i.e. highly portable) secure bootloader which is standards-compatible and easy to integrate into existing embedded software projects.

![What is rustBoot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20253082/131283947-98b77b33-65e9-4a6a-b554-4ec6fb4813c2.png "So, how does rustBoot help")

## Features currently supported:

- [x] support for `ARM Cortex-M, Cortex-A` micro-architectures
- [x] support for multi-slot partitioning of microcontroller flash memory. This allows us to implement the `boot/update` approach for bare-metal `firmware updates`.
- [x] support for `Aarch64 linux` booting
- [x] elliptic curve cryptography for integrity and authenticity verification using [`RustCrypto`](https://github.com/RustCrypto) crates
- [x] a tiny hardware abstraction layer for non-volatile memory (i.e. flash) access.
- [x] anti-rollback protection via version numbering.
- [x] a fully memory safe core-bootloader implementation with safe parsers and firmware-update logic.
- [x] power-interruptible firmware updates along with the assurance of fall-back availability.

## Features planned:

- [ ] switch to `rust-based signing tools` for manifest-header creation, key-generation and firmware signing to improve scalability and security (currently examples use a python implementation for this). 
- [ ] support for external flash devices (ex: SPI flash) and serial/console logging interfaces.
- [ ] support for `ARM TrustZone-M and A` and certified `secure hardware elements` - microchip ATECC608a, NXP SE050, STSAFE-100
- [ ] support for a highly secure and efficient `firmware transport` method over end-end mutually authenticated and encrypted channels via [ockam-networking-libraries](https://github.com/ockam-network/ockam/tree/develop/documentation/use-cases/end-to-end-encryption-with-rust#readme).

## Documentation:

You can read the book for <a href="https://nihalpasham.github.io/rustBoot-book/index.html" target="_blank">`free online`.</a>. 

> Note: `rustBoot` and the `book` are still in development (i.e. a work in progress).

## Acknowledgment: 

rustBoot's design was influenced by [wolfBoot](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfBoot). It borrows wolfBoot's `reliable-update` design idea and builds on it with rust's memory safety guarantees, safer parsing libraries, compile-time state-transition checks and easy integration with crates (such as boards, HALs drivers etc.) developed by the [embedded-rust](https://crates.io/categories/embedded) community.
